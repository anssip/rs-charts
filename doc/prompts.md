# Add initial chart configuration


Is it now possible to supply the initial indicators, symbol and time granularity to this chart library
so that it uses those to load the initial candles and indicators to show? Or is it now first loading candles
using a default (BTC-USD) symbol and 1 hour granularity? I'd like it to be possible to provide the initial
configuration at the start of the app so that it loads using correct data.

# Remove the logo

Remove the logo from the bottom left corner or the chart.
